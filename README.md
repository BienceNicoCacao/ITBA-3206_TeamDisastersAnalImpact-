# Strategic Preparedness for Disaster with DIA
**_Introduction_**

The Philippines is vulnerable to natural disasters due to its location along the typhoon belt and the Pacific ring of fire. Thousands of lives have been lost, millions of people have been displaced, and hundreds of billions of dollars have been lost as a result of disaster events in the last decade.
The Philippines is one of the most affected countries by natural disasters in the world this is because the Philippines is located along the Ring of Fire or the preferred term which is the typhoon belt where many earthquakes and eruptions will occur within its premises. Natural disasters are increasing the social and economic costs in the country as a result of population growth, migration, and global climate change (Natural Disaster Risk Management in the Philippines, 2005). According to Rosy Mina (2021) COVID19 pandemic was not the only disaster to strike the Philippines in 2020. The year started with a volcanic eruption and ended with two magnitude 6 earthquakes, one of which occurred on Christmas morning. Meanwhile, Typhoon Goni arrived, an end-of-season super storm that was the strongest in 2020. Disaster Risk Reduction provides the key strategic actions that emphasize activities centered on community awareness and understanding; emergency planning; Conducting local exercises and developing national disaster preparedness plan.

Disasters can happen at any time. 
So we envision a world in which communities are filled with hope, have overcome adversity, are prepared for disasters, and have recovered from traumatic experiences.

To protect your home and family, it's important to be prepared and have a plan. The objective of this analysis is to generate an explanation for Disasters Impact Analysis (DIA) from the year 2019 to reduce disaster consequences in terms of recovery time, cost, and suffering. Moreover, to expand the awareness of each Filipino citizen and to lessen the impact of disasters on vulnerable populations, prepares an organization for an influx of activities, and creates a coordinated plan that saves resources, time, and effort.

**_Problem Statement_**

Preparedness is a critical aspect in catastrophe mitigation in disaster-prone countries. There are various approaches to disaster management. However, one thing these approaches have in common is that they are "preventive." The primary components of the preventive approach are preparedness and education. It is possible to increase the capacity to cope with disasters, which vary in terms of their development periods and times and usually involve uncertainty, by raising awareness of all components, all individuals, and all communities in line with this common cause.

The Philippines is one of the most affected countries by natural disasters in the world this is because the Philippines is located along the Ring of Fire or the preferred term which is the typhoon belt where many earthquakes and eruptions will occur within its premises. Natural disasters are increasing the social and economic costs in the country as a result of population growth, migration, and global climate change (Natural Disaster Risk Management in the Philippines, 2005). Calamities such as storms, typhoons, and earthquakes reveal how incapable the country's disaster management is in coping with the impact of disasters due to the inefficiency of planning, lack of facilities and equipment, the flawed predictions of upcoming disasters, the slow rate of reparation of the damages, and the ineffectiveness of the implemented disaster risk management laws. 

There is a need to move away from focusing on specific hazards and toward strategic approaches to reducing vulnerabilities before hazardous events occur. Prior to any hazardous event, it is necessary to be aware of potential hazards, whether they are physical, economic, or environmental vulnerabilities. With this knowledge, first responders and the government can conquer any hazard rather than assessing what went wrong after the event. Focusing on specific hazards is a difficult task, thus understanding the underlying vulnerabilities to infrastructure, hazardous material, or the economy are vital in risk management. Policy makers and first responders alike can use this information to prevent risk and hazardous events. In 2001, the nation was extremely vulnerable and did not have the proper measures in place to address damages to infrastructure, the economic impact of recovering from a large-scale attack, or the health hazards the attack created for first responders. Underlying vulnerabilities should first and foremost be addressed before focusing on a specific hazard.

**_Significance of the Proposed Project_**

A disaster risk reduction approach helps us consider our emergency response activities in light of existing and new disaster risks. This empowers us to plan or alter our exercises so that individuals and communities gotten to be more secure and more disaster-resilient, as well as shielding endeavors to make and extend empowering conditions for maintainable destitution easing and development.

DRR approaches and tools will prevent relief work from rebuilding the vulnerabilities that made people prone to similar disasters. DRR provides valuable insights into the underlying factors of vulnerability to hazards and the features of those hazards. It helps us identify and map local capacities to cope with these hazards. Ultimately, the DRR approach helps us conduct effective disaster response while reducing risks that similar disasters will reoccur. It also ensures that our emergency response does no harm by replacing or reinstating critical vulnerabilities.


**_Government:_** It helps the government to develop and prepare a local or national disaster management plan to ensure that there constituents know how to deal/respond in a disaster.

**_Community:_** Provides education and protect the lives and livelihoods of communities and individuals who are most vulnerable to disasters or emergencies.

**_Teacher and Students:_** The security of schools is important and DRR points at lessening the helplessness to, and affect of disasters on schools. It prepares both teachers and students for potential catastrophes, in this manner of decreasing the affect of the said disaster or catastrophe.

**_Methods_**

The Disasters Impact Analysis(DIA)method is to help those organizations have more understanding of disaster impacts and facilitate their decision making in order to prepare better mitigation plans.The objectives of the first study were to: document the impacts of natural disasters on social and economic development of the Philippines; assess the country's current capacity to reduce and manage disaster risk; and identify options for more effective management of that risk. This follow-on study is intended to support the first study and examine in more detail some of the specific areas under the above themes and provide directions for necessary actions.

**_Expected Output_**


The overall goal of Strategic Preparedness for Disaster with DIA is to improve the preparedness and response of Disaster Management Services (DMS) involved in emergency situations in order to reduce casualties and improve survival rates among mass casualties. The expected impacts of the Strategic Preparedness for Disaster with DIA  project are:

•	Improved preparedness of Disaster Management Services

•	Improved response of Disaster Management Services

•	Improved cross-border co-operation

•	A comprehensive set of operating procedures & processes

•	A comprehensive set of tools

•	A comprehensive training tools

•	Improved logistics

•	Improved understanding of legal, ethical and social issues in major emergency management

•	Improved understanding of public acceptance in major emergency management

In addition to the most important technological results for improving the important crisis preparation and answers, additional objectives are that the project can offer improvements to existing technologies and methodologies that are most important to partners and end users.
