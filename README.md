# Strategic Preparedness for Disaster with DIA
**_Introduction_**

The Philippines is vulnerable to natural disasters due to its location along the typhoon belt and the Pacific ring of fire. Thousands of lives have been lost, millions of people have been displaced, and hundreds of billions of dollars have been lost as a result of disaster events in the last decade.
The Philippines is one of the most affected countries by natural disasters in the world this is because the Philippines is located along the Ring of Fire or the preferred term which is the typhoon belt where many earthquakes and eruptions will occur within its premises. Natural disasters are increasing the social and economic costs in the country as a result of population growth, migration, and global climate change (Natural Disaster Risk Management in the Philippines, 2005). According to Rosy Mina (2021) COVID19 pandemic was not the only disaster to strike the Philippines in 2020. The year started with a volcanic eruption and ended with two magnitude 6 earthquakes, one of which occurred on Christmas morning. Meanwhile, Typhoon Goni arrived, an end-of-season super storm that was the strongest in 2020. Disaster Risk Reduction provides the key strategic actions that emphasize activities centered on community awareness and understanding; emergency planning; Conducting local exercises and developing national disaster preparedness plan.

Disasters can happen at any time. 
So we envision a world in which communities are filled with hope, have overcome adversity, are prepared for disasters, and have recovered from traumatic experiences.

To protect your home and family, it's important to be prepared and have a plan. The objective of this analysis is to generate an explanation for Disasters Impact Analysis (DIA) from the year 2019 to reduce disaster consequences in terms of recovery time, cost, and suffering. Moreover, to expand the awareness of each Filipino citizen and to lessen the impact of disasters on vulnerable populations, prepares an organization for an influx of activities, and creates a coordinated plan that saves resources, time, and effort.

**_Significance of the Proposed Project_**

A disaster risk reduction approach helps us consider our emergency response activities in light of existing and new disaster risks. This empowers us to plan or alter our exercises so that individuals and communities gotten to be more secure and more disaster-resilient, as well as shielding endeavors to make and extend empowering conditions for maintainable destitution easing and development.

DRR approaches and tools will prevent relief work from rebuilding the vulnerabilities that made people prone to similar disasters. DRR provides valuable insights into the underlying factors of vulnerability to hazards and the features of those hazards. It helps us identify and map local capacities to cope with these hazards. Ultimately, the DRR approach helps us conduct effective disaster response while reducing risks that similar disasters will reoccur. It also ensures that our emergency response does no harm by replacing or reinstating critical vulnerabilities.
